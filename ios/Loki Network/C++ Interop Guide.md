There are a few steps that need to be taken to get the Loki Network C++ library to interoperate with Swift. They're a bit tricky to figure out, so for future reference:

- Run `make -j8` from the loki-network root folder
- Drag the following files into the project and make sure they're included under Build Phases → Link Binary With Libraries:
  - build/libabyss.a
  - build/libutp/liblibutp.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/base/libabsl_base.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/base/libabsl_internal_malloc_internal.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/base/libabsl_internal_spinlock_wait.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/base/libabsl_internal_throw_delegate.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/debugging/libabsl_stacktrace.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/debugging/libabsl_symbolize.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/hash/libabsl_hash.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/hash/libabsl_internal_city.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/numeric/libabsl_int128.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/strings/libabsl_strings.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/synchronization/libabsl_synchronization.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/time/libabsl_time.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/types/libabsl_bad_optional_access.a
  - build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/types/libabsl_variant.a
  - build/vendor/libcppbackport.a
  - build/crypto/liblokinet-cryptography.a
  - build/llarp/liblokinet-util.a
  - build/llarp/liblokinet-platform.a
  - build/llarp/liblokinet-static.a
- Update Build Settings → **Library** Search Paths to include `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../`:
  - `build`
  - `build/libutp`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/base`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/debugging`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/hash`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/numeric`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/strings`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/synchronization`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/time`
  - `build/vendor/abseil-cpp/absl/types`
  - `build/vendor`
  - `build/crypto`
  - `build/llarp`
- Drag llarp/util/logger.hpp and include/llarp.h into the project
- Update Build Settings → **System** Header Search Paths to include `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../` ... `llarp/util` and `include`
- Create a liblokinet-wrapper.cpp, include logger.h and llarp.h, and wrap the LLARP functions you want to expose. `opendir$INODE64`, `readdir$INODE64` and `readdir_r$INODE64` must be wrapped as well as a workaround for an issue where Xcode can't find these functions during linking when targeting iOS
- Create a liblokinet-wrapper.h and include any imports needed for the function definitions
- Create a Loki-Network-Bridging-Header.h and include liblokinet-wrapper.h
- Set Build Settings → Objective-C Bridging Header to Loki-Network-Bridging-Header.h
- Update Build Settings → **System** Header Search Paths to include `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../`:
  - `llarp`
  - `crypto/include`
  - `vendor/abseil-cpp`
  - `vendor/nlohmann/include`
